In this project I will use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform analysis and data exploration of the provided climate databse, utilizing the provided files "hawaii.sqlite", "hawaii_measurements.csv", and "hawaii_stations.csv" which are in the folder titled "adv_data_storage." 

In the folder titled "adv_data_storage" you will find a file labeled "climate_starter.ipynb" which contains my Jupyter Notebook with Precipitation Analysis, Station Analysis, and Climate App which utilizes a Flask API based on the queries performed on the provided data.

I did run into an error when running flask in the app.py file in my IDE, so you may have to refresh the links after they have been clicked-the JSON lists usually ran on the first click of the link but occassionally I had to refresh the page to display the data.
